title: TMC Bump Sensitivity
brief: Set sensorless homing sensitivity
author: thinkyhead,mbuc

experimental: false
requires: HAVE_TMC2130,SENSORLESS_HOMING
group: control

codes:
  - M914

long: Some TMC stepper drivers have the ability to detect when they bump into something that causes them to stop moving. This feature is so sensitive that it can actually take the place of traditional endstops. Set the bump sensitivity for the X and Y stepper drivers here.

notes:
  - Requires `SENSORLESS_HOMING` in `Configuration_adv.h`.
  - This feature is currently only compatible with the TMC2130.
  - It is advised to set both `X_HOME_BUMP_MM` and `Y_HOME_BUMP_MM` to 0.
  - Higher values = Lower sensitivity.

parameters:
  -
